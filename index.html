					<h2>Why feminism is necessary</h2>
						<p>The gender inequalities in today’s society might not be as great as they once where, but they are still here and are affecting our everyday life. For instance a study from 2010 based on the difference in salary between women and men in the EU showed that for every US dollar men earned, women earned 84 cents. The same study in the US showed that for every US dollar men earned, women earned 77 cents.</p>

						<div id="more1">
						<p class="bort">Plenty of countries have established laws to push the gender equality question further. But the foremost problem is society’s expectations of the genders. One example is that since there are more men in leadership roles, women are not expected to achieve those professions, and therefore women don't try.</p>
						<p>Proving this statistics from the UN in 2014 shows that only one in five political participants are women, that’s one and a half to few. Also the annual Fortune 500 list, ranking the top 500 US companies showed that only 4% of those companies had female CEOs, that is 46% to few!</p>

						<div class="col2"> 
					<h3>The definition of feminism</h3>
						<p>A feminist is a person who believes that women - simply by being women – are minor to men. And that instead our world should be equal no matter gender.</p>
						<p>This description can apply to anyone, regardless gender, social class or appearance. A feminist is someone with beliefs and complies the objectives of gender equality. This doesn’t necessarily have to be a person who is political active, just as someone who calls themselves an environmentalist don’t have to be at the frontline for saving the rainforest from getting slaughtered.</p>

				<h2>Stereotyped</h2>
						<p>In 2003 two US professors ran an experiment to test the perceptions of men and women in the workplace. The participants where to read the same case study about a successful entrepreneur, half of them where told that the persons name was Heidi and the other half where told it was Howard. Even tough the participants rated Heidi and Howard equally competent, Howard came across as a more appealing work colleague. The conclusion is that a successful man is liked by both genders, but a successful woman is less liked by both women and men.</p>

					<p class="bort">In other words we subconsciously provide certain properties to people based on their gender. The stereotypical gender properties can be described with dualism, their each other’s antithesis. Society’s expectations are that females have attributes that the males don’t hold and the other way around.</p>
					<p>Already in young ages we are treated differently because of our gender. For example it’s usual for parents to speak more to their infant girl than to their boy, furthermore mothers tend to underestimate their girls ability to crawl and over estimate their boys ability to crawl.</p>

					<h3>Dirty word</h3>
						<p>The people above are all acknowledged feminists, a word that for decades has been a dirty word, a label thet included hatred against the male gender. Mainly because earlier feminists felt that they had to take on the fight themselves, therefore the resistance towards males.
						<p>Today plenty males describe themselves as feminists, which is a step in the right direction, because we can’t achieve a gender equal world if we don’t approach the problem with gender equal values.</p>

						<h2>It's about equality</h2>
						<p>Women and men should be equally paid, equally noticed in the media, equally considered for a job, equally dividing the duties at home etc. One shouldn’t be categorised by society because of gender. Furthermore not only women have a disadvantage by these gender roles, as we approach a more gender equal society stereotypes for both women and men will evanesce.</p>

						<div id="more3">
							<p class="bort">Not until women have supportive employers and colleagues as well as parents who share family responsibilities, we can obtain gender equality. And the same goes for men, when they are fully respected for contributing inside the home gender equality is a fact. </p>	
					<p>Not all women want careers. Not all women want children. But all women should be able to choose freely. Conditions for all women will improve when there are equally as many women with leadership roles giving a strong and powerful voice to womens needs and concerns. </p>
